Next.js Templates for a Dynamic Agency “Lab” Site (2026)
Building your agency’s site as a dynamic, periodical “lab” requires modern Next.js starters that support fast content updates, MDX-based blogging, Tailwind design, and easy AI integrations. Below are 6 top Next.js 15+ templates (both free and premium under $100) that fit your needs, each with links, features, and pros/cons for your use case:
1. Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog (Timlrx) – Open Source (Free)
Link: GitHub ・ Demo: tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app
Tech Stack: Next.js App Router (v13+), Tailwind CSS, Contentlayer, MDX, TypeScript.
What’s Included: A full-featured markdown/MDX blogging template with out-of-the-box features like dark mode, tags/categories, table of contents, code syntax highlighting, RSS feed, SEO-friendly metadata, and even a built-in newsletter subscription form[1]. It comes with example pages (home with latest posts, an about page, tags page, etc.) and a content folder for MDX posts. It’s extremely popular and well-maintained – widely adopted by many developers for their blogs[2] (10k+ GitHub stars).
Pros: This starter is battle-tested and optimized for performance and SEO (nearly perfect Lighthouse scores). It uses static generation for speed and supports Contentlayer for MDX, meaning you can write posts in Git (Markdown/MDX) and trigger Vercel redeploys with each push – perfect for daily AI-generated updates[3]. The code is clean and well-documented, making it easy to customize styling or add new pages. Many common blog enhancements are pre-built (e.g. reading-time indicators, view counters, multi-author support)[1], so you won’t have to reinvent them. There’s a strong community, so you’ll find lots of examples and even community forks with added features. It’s also already using the Next.js App Router in version 2.0 (refactored for React Server Components)[4], ensuring you’re on the latest architecture.
Cons: Out of the box, it’s primarily a blog-oriented template – you’ll need to create your custom pages for services, portfolio, etc. (it does not include pre-styled service or project pages). However, since it’s built with Tailwind and MDX, you can relatively easily author new sections or pages by following the existing layout patterns. The design aesthetic is fairly minimal (clean blog style); to match your desired “agency lab” feel, you’ll likely adjust the color palette (which is trivial via Tailwind config) and add custom components (pricing tables, hero sections, etc.). It doesn’t use a UI kit like shadcn/ui by default, so you’d manually style or import any custom components – not a huge drawback given Tailwind’s utility, but something to note. There’s no built-in “AI” feature, but you wouldn’t expect that in a starter blog. AI integration would be done by you (for example, you can add a serverless route using the Vercel AI SDK to generate MDX content). Fortunately, the template’s structure (Next.js API routes and Contentlayer) makes it straightforward to script AI content creation – e.g. a script or API route could take a transcript and output an .mdx file in the content folder for automatic deployment.
Use-Case Adaptability: This template is a great foundation for the “lab” concept – it ensures publishing new articles is as simple as git push (perfect for updating via a mobile editor app). You’d spend time building the non-blog pages (services, contact, etc.) using the same layout components. Since it’s popular, you can find pre-built snippets (e.g. Tailwind components for pricing tables or CTAs) to drop in. In short, if you want maximum flexibility and don’t mind assembling some pages yourself, Timlrx’s starter is a top choice[2].
2. Next.js MDX + Shadcn Blog Starter (ChangoMan) – Open Source (Free)
Link: GitHub ・ Demo: nextjs-typescript-mdx-blog.vercel.app
Tech Stack: Next.js App Router, MDX via Contentlayer, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, TypeScript[5].
What’s Included: A lightweight Next.js 13+ starter for a personal site or blog, built with modern stack ingredients. It includes a basic homepage (listing blog posts) and MDX blog pages. Notably, it integrates shadcn/ui (which is a collection of Radix UI + Tailwind components) for a clean, accessible UI out-of-the-box[5]. You get the standard blog features (MDX content, syntax highlighting, SEO tags) and a simple design inspired by Lee Robinson’s blog.
Pros: This starter is already configured for Next.js App Router (it was updated in Aug 2023 for that)[6], so you’re using the latest Next.js file structure. The use of shadcn/ui means you have a set of pre-styled, headless components (dialogs, dropdowns, etc.) ready to use – which aligns with your desire for clean and customizable UI. The template’s design philosophy is minimal and unopinionated, which is great for an agency site – you can easily theme it with your brand colors (teal, navy, orange accents) without fighting against an existing heavy style. Because it’s built on Contentlayer + MDX, adding new blog posts is as simple as dropping an MDX file into the posts folder and pushing to Git[3]. It’s fast and static by default, and includes essentials like a sitemap and RSS generation. The footprint is small (only ~430 stars, indicating niche but active) and the codebase is easy to grok or extend. If you plan to integrate AI features, the presence of shadcn/Radix components could help in building any interactive UI (for example, a custom <ChatbotModal> or <TranscriptUploader> dialog using Radix primitives). And because it’s TypeScript throughout, you’ll get type safety when integrating things like the Vercel AI SDK or Replicate APIs.
Cons: Being a slim starter, it doesn’t come with pre-built marketing sections beyond the blog. You will need to create your Home/Lab page layout (to feature recent posts and perhaps your services overview) and pages like “Services” or “About” yourself. However, since you have shadcn’s component library at your disposal, you can construct these pages using those building blocks (cards, buttons, navbar, etc.) rather than coding all UI from scratch. The documentation is basically just the README; there’s no extensive guide, so initial setup (though straightforward) is on you. Another minor point: shadcn/ui components are copied into your project (not an npm package), which is great for customization but means you’ll manually update them if needed. In terms of style, the default look is very minimal (mostly unstyled aside from basic Tailwind classes), so to achieve a “premium but not corporate” feel, you’ll invest some time in design tweaking – think adjusting spacing, adding your imagery, maybe subtle animations (you can use Tailwind CSS and @headlessui for that).
Use-Case Adaptability: This starter hits many of your tech requirements: Next 13 App Router, Tailwind v3, shadcn/ui, MDX, etc., with zero bloat. It’s perfect if you prefer a “framework” to build on, rather than a finished theme – you’ll have full control to craft your homepage, services pages, and components like pricing tables (possibly by leveraging shadcn’s pre-built UI elements). Because it’s already wired for MDX content, your daily blog updates workflow is inherently supported. Integrating AI content generation can be done by writing scripts or API routes that create MDX files (since Contentlayer will auto-import new files at build) – very similar to the Timlrx starter approach. Overall, ChangoMan’s template is a “modern minimal” starter that gives you a solid technical foundation with less design, which for an engineer-led approach (with AI assistance) can be ideal[5].
3. MDX Static Blog Template (Velite + Shadcn) – Open Source (Free)
Link: GitHub (devbertskie) ・ Demo: devbertskie-mdx.vercel.app
Tech Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), Velite JS (content layer), MDX, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Zod schemas[7].
What’s Included: A developer-centric MDX blog starter that swaps out Contentlayer for Velite – a new tool that turns local Markdown/MDX files into a typed data layer using Zod schemas[8]. It’s essentially a Next.js 14 blog, very similar in feature set to other MDX blogs (syntax highlighting for code, responsive design, etc.), but using Velite under the hood. This template is built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind for styling[9], so it looks modern and is mobile-responsive. You get MDX support (with JSX components in MDX if needed) and a basic site structure for listing posts and viewing them.
Pros: Velite is an emerging alternative to Contentlayer that provides type-safe content definitions – this could be beneficial if you want strong validation or custom structures for your content. For example, you could define a schema for “AI Action Items” in a transcript post, and Velite (with Zod) will ensure the MDX frontmatter or content meets that schema. This template already sets up Velite, saving you that integration work[8]. It also uses shadcn’s UI components, giving you a nice set of accessible, easily themeable UI pieces (buttons, modals, etc.), similar to the ChangoMan starter. Performance-wise, Next 14 and static generation ensure the site is fast and SEO-friendly. MDX content means your Git-based publishing workflow is naturally supported. The responsive design and styling are done with Tailwind, and being a small project, it’s easy to customize. If you’re excited about using cutting-edge tools, this starter’s use of Velite might appeal to you (and it’s a talking point to say your site leverages the latest static site tech). It has code and content in one place, so updating or extending it (e.g., adding a new page or new content fields) is straightforward.
Cons: Velite is relatively new and less popular than Contentlayer (this repo has ~50 stars[10]). That means fewer community examples or support, and possible quirks since it’s not as battle-tested. If you’re comfortable with Contentlayer already, adopting Velite has a slight learning curve (though the concepts are similar). The feature set of this template is fairly basic – it’s primarily a blog. It likely doesn’t include advanced features like tag filtering, search, or multi-author out of the box (those you’d add if needed). Also, since it’s a one-person project template, documentation beyond the README may be minimal. Another consideration: if at some point you prefer to switch back to Contentlayer, you’d have to refactor a bit; Contentlayer and Velite serve similar purposes, so you wouldn’t use both.
Use-Case Adaptability: For your needs, this template is a viable starting point if you want to explore type-safe MDX content. It aligns with all your core requirements (Next 15-ready, Tailwind, shadcn, MDX). Creating service pages or portfolios would be similar to the previous starter – you’ll build them out using React and Tailwind (with shadcn components where helpful). Velite can also process data formats beyond MDX (like YAML/JSON), which might be handy if you decide to store structured data (say, a YAML file for service offerings or pricing tiers that Velite transforms into JSON at build time). In terms of AI integration: because content is file-based, you would use a process where your AI tools output MDX/Markdown files that adhere to the expected schema (ensuring any AI-generated frontmatter meets your Zod definitions). Velite would then incorporate those on the next build. If you plan to do on-demand AI content generation on the site itself, you could add Next API routes – no conflict there. Given that this is a smaller project, adopting it means you’re somewhat on your own for enhancements, but the flip side is zero bloat and full control. In summary, it’s a future-forward MDX starter that’s perfectly tuned for Git workflows, with the only caveat being its relative novelty[9][7].
4. NextPro – Multipurpose Next.js Agency Template (ThemeForest, $21 one-time)

NextPro – a Tailwind CSS Next.js template designed for digital agencies (multiple homepage and blog styles shown)
Link: ThemeForest – NextPro ・ Demo: (See “Live Preview” on ThemeForest)
Tech Stack: Next.js 14 (React 18), Tailwind CSS 3.3, extensive use of React libraries (Swiper sliders, React Slick, Leaflet maps, Framer Motion animations, etc.)[11][12]. Uses static Next.js pages (likely with file-system routing) and is fully TypeScript. Updated as of mid-2025 with Next.js 14 features and Tailwind v3 – ready for Next 15+ compatibility.
What’s Included: NextPro is a comprehensive, pre-designed template pack for marketing agencies. It comes with 5+ distinct homepage layouts and 16+ inner pages ready to use[13]. This includes pages for Services (with multiple style sections), Case Studies/Portfolio, Pricing plans, About Us, Contact (with working forms), and multiple blog layouts (grid, list, with/without sidebars, etc.)[14][15]. Essentially, every section you mentioned is available: hero sections, service feature listings, pricing tables (monthly/yearly toggle)[16], testimonial carousels, client logos, call-to-action banners, and more. The design is modern and professional (agency/consultancy style) – it uses ample whitespace, smooth hover animations, and a palette that you can customize (by default it’s often blues, but easily adjust via Tailwind config or CSS). It supports dark mode as well, with ready styles for both light and dark[17]. Images and graphics are included as examples (often using Unsplash photos and illustrations). NextPro is also well-documented and includes build instructions, so setup is straightforward.
Pros: The biggest advantage here is speed to launch and breadth of design – since it includes so many pre-built pages and components, you can assemble your site by mostly swapping in your content and branding. For example, there’s a dedicated “Services” page design where you can outline your 3 service pillars (WordPress Care, AI Marketing, System Integration) complete with icons or images, plus a pricing section for retainers (e.g. a pricing table with $150/$300/$500 tiers is already designed in the template’s Pricing Section)[16]. There’s even a section for “AI in Marketing” under services by default[18], which aligns perfectly with one of your offerings. The blog being pre-designed in multiple styles gives you flexibility on how to present your “Lab” posts (maybe a card grid on the homepage and a classic list on a Blog page, etc.). Because this is a static template, it’s very fast – pages are statically generated and assets are optimized. SEO considerations like semantic HTML, heading hierarchy, and meta tags are built in (and you can adjust them as needed). The code is described as clean and well-structured[19], and since it’s Tailwind-based, you can change the theme colors globally. It’s also using the latest Next.js features for performance (and will work on Vercel seamlessly). For your workflow: even though NextPro doesn’t natively use MDX or a CMS, you can integrate Contentlayer or MDX fairly easily – treat the provided blog pages as a styling/layout template, and wire them up to your MDX content source. This way you get the best of both: a polished front-end and your Git-driven content. Lastly, at $21 it’s quite affordable for the value (one-time cost for a single-site license)[20], and you get 6 months of support from the author if you encounter issues.
Cons: Being a premium template, there is some initial overhead to integrate your content workflow. Out-of-the-box, the blog pages might be statically filled with dummy posts (or use local JSON). To hook it into daily generated posts, you’ll want to implement Contentlayer/MDX – that means creating a Contentlayer config and perhaps tweaking the blog [index] page to list MDX files instead of a JS array. This is a bit of upfront coding, but it’s a one-time task. Similarly, if you want to use a headless CMS or any dynamic content, you’d integrate that – but given your preference for Git/MDX, sticking with MDX is simplest. Another consideration: feature bloat – NextPro includes a lot of sections and external libraries (sliders, maps, counters). If you’re not using some, you might want to remove their imports to keep your bundle slim. For instance, if you don’t need a map or countdown timer, you can strip out Leaflet and the countdown script. This cleanup isn’t strictly required (the site will work with them), but it’s nice to do. The design style, while modern, is also somewhat “template-y” initially – you’ll need to infuse it with custom imagery and tweak colors to avoid looking like a stock template. The good news is Tailwind makes that easy, and small touches like replacing stock photos with AI-generated or project-specific images will immediately make it feel bespoke. Also, NextPro does not use shadcn or Radix – so, if you need additional interactive components not provided, you might use something like Headless UI or custom code for those (the template does include basic interactive components though).
Use-Case Adaptability: NextPro is very well-suited to an agency site – it was literally built for digital service agencies. All the key pages you listed are accounted for. You can likely reuse the existing layouts almost verbatim: e.g., use one of the Home variants as your “Lab” home (populate it with your latest blog posts, which could be done by embedding a dynamic component in that static page to fetch MDX content at build time), use the provided Services page structure to detail each service (WordPress Care, etc.), use the Pricing tables for your plans (adjust text/prices as needed), and plug in the Contact page which has a working form (you might wire it to an email or a service like Formspree/Vercel’s form API). The daily blog updates will require connecting the template’s blog to your content pipeline, but once done, posting a new article is as easy as git push (the site will rebuild on Vercel). In terms of AI integration: although NextPro doesn’t include any AI-specific features by default, you have full control to add them. For example, you could create an API route /api/generate-post that uses the Vercel AI SDK to generate MDX from a transcript – you’d invoke this from an admin page or even locally. The template’s structure won’t conflict with that; Next.js 14 allows hybrid pages and API routes. Another idea: if you want to generate hero images for posts using DALL-E/Replicate, you could incorporate that into your content generation script and just reference the image URLs in your MDX frontmatter. Bottom line: design-wise and layout-wise, NextPro covers 90% of your needs out of the box[18][16]. The remaining 10% is integrating the “brain” of the site (your AI content workflow), which is very achievable given NextPro’s solid React/Tailwind foundation.
5. Agency – Next.js Portfolio/Agency Template (NextjsTemplates, $59 one-time)

“Agency” Next.js Template – Hero section of the default homepage (light mode), featuring a clean layout and modern typography.
Link: Agency Template by NextjsTemplates.com ・ Demo: agency.demo.nextjstemplates.com
Tech Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router)[21], Tailwind CSS 3.x, Radix UI & shadcn (likely for some components), Prisma + PostgreSQL (for database), NextAuth.js (auth), Sanity CMS (for blog), Stripe (payments)[22]. This is essentially a full-stack template – not just static pages, but with integrations for CMS, auth, and subscriptions.
What’s Included: The Agency template is an all-in-one starter kit specifically designed for creative agencies and portfolio sites. It was last updated December 2025 and built on Next.js 16, so it’s cutting-edge. You get pre-built pages for everything: multiple Home page variants, Services page, Portfolio/Case Studies page, Pricing page, Blog pages, About, Contact, plus utility pages like Testimonials, Team, Sign In/Up, and even a Docs page and 404. The navigation is set up with dropdown menus for subpages (as seen in the demo). It’s packed with essential sections: project portfolio grids with filters, team member profiles, testimonial sliders, and lead-generation forms. The styling is clean and modern – lots of white space, crisp typography, subtle use of brand color (default is a bluish-purple which you’d change to your teal/amber). Animations and effects are implemented (probably using Framer Motion or CSS for fade-ins). Uniquely, it comes integrated with Sanity.io as a CMS for the blog (so non-developers could publish content via Sanity’s UI), and user authentication via NextAuth (should you need client logins for something). It even has a Prisma/Postgres setup ready, which could be used for contact form submissions or any data you want to capture. Stripe integration is included to demonstrate handling subscriptions/payments (for instance, if your agency wanted to accept online payments or sell a productized service, the pieces are there).
Pros: This template is enterprise-grade in terms of feature completeness. If NextPro was a great front-end, Agency is a great full-stack solution. For a one-person agency with 30+ years experience, using this template can level-up your site with features usually only seen in larger setups. For example, you could have a “Client Portal” or gated content by leveraging the NextAuth portion – or simply remove it if not needed. The design quality is high: professional and “premium” without being overly flashy. It avoids the cookie-cutter look by including nice touches (for instance, angled section dividers, on-scroll animations, etc.). Accessibility and SEO are taken seriously (Next.js 16 with App Router means you use the new <Head> SEO API, etc.). A huge advantage is the included documentation and support – NextjsTemplates provides docs and you can get help if needed.
From a technical perspective, you meet all your requirements: Next 16 (so definitely App Router), Tailwind 100%, likely shadcn UI is used under the hood for components (tags, modals, etc.), MDX/Contentlayer is not used because they opted for Sanity CMS – but you can easily add MDX support or swap out Sanity for Contentlayer if you prefer. Since Sanity content is queried at build time, switching to MDX would actually simplify things (no external calls). The presence of Prisma and a database means you have flexibility to store any structured data (maybe store form submissions, or your AI-generated “action items” in a database table for an internal dashboard – though that’s beyond the website’s immediate scope, it’s nice to have the option). Stripe integration means the template has a built-in Pricing page and even the logic to handle checkout or subscriptions (for example, they mention it’s set up to manage subscriptions via Stripe)[23][24]. If in the future you wanted to offer a paid newsletter or sell digital products, the foundation is already there.
Pros for your specific workflow: The blog is already configured with a CMS (Sanity) which could be a pro or con. For you, it might be a con (since you want Git-based), but note that using Sanity doesn’t preclude Git – you could run Sanity in the background and still generate the site statically. However, if you truly want to edit posts via Git from your phone with an editor like VSCode or Claude, you might not want the Sanity dependency. The good news is that because they integrated Sanity through @sanity/client, you can fairly easily replace that with Contentlayer + MDX. The template’s blog page designs and components can stay – you’d just fetch data from local files instead of the Sanity API. It’s a one-time swap that shouldn’t be too painful (especially if you’re comfortable with Next.js). In return, you get beautifully designed blog listings and post layouts without coding them from scratch.
Another pro: The “Lab” homepage concept can shine with this template – you can mix dynamic content (recent blog posts, which you’ll have), static marketing sections (your service overview, CTA to book consultation), and maybe even embed an AI widget. Since the template has NextAuth, you could protect an admin route where you run internal tools (like an interface to generate new posts from transcripts, if you don’t want to solely rely on Git pushes – you could paste a transcript in an admin textarea and have it call OpenAI and create a draft). This is above-and-beyond the template’s intended use, but it illustrates the flexibility you have with all these integrations. Essentially, Agency template gives you a robust skeleton that you can grow into – which might future-proof your site for years (you won’t outgrow it easily).
Cons: The flipside of all those features is complexity. This template is doing a lot, and if you won’t use certain parts, you may spend time removing or disabling them. For example, if you decide not to use the Sanity CMS, you’ll want to excise that code and perhaps the dependency (which means also removing any GROQ queries, Sanity-specific components, etc.). Same with the Stripe integration – if you have no use for payments/subscriptions on your site initially, that code sits idle. It’s not harming anything per se, but as a meticulous developer you might not want unused code. Stripping out auth, CMS, and Stripe is doable but will require reading the docs to see where those are wired in. Alternatively, you can leave them and simply not expose links (the site will still run). Another con is performance overhead: this template does more server-side work (auth, CMS calls) – it won’t be as blazingly fast as a purely static site unless you static-export most pages. However, Next.js App Router supports incremental static regeneration and caching, so you can likely cache the CMS responses. It’s a minor consideration given modern hosting, but worth noting – a slim blog template (like #1-3) will be a bit simpler in architecture than this full-stack app.
Also, cost: at $59 it’s the priciest on this list (still under $100, and it is one-time). It includes a commercial license and lifetime updates[25], so value-wise it’s justified, but it’s a factor. Lastly, because it’s so comprehensive, expect the learning curve to be a bit higher – you’ll want to spend time reading its documentation to understand how pages are structured (especially how data flows from Sanity to the pages). For a solo builder this is usually fine, but plan for a few days of familiarization.
Use-Case Adaptability: If you want a turnkey professional site and are willing to adapt the content workflow, Agency is arguably the most “all-inclusive” solution. It aligns with the aesthetic you described: “premium but not corporate stiff; approachable tech but human”. The demo itself feels like a modern tech agency site – you would mainly infuse your personality into it via content and imagery. Every feature you might dream of (from daily blog updates to scheduling consultations) can be accommodated. For example, the Contact page could be adapted into a “Book a Consultation” page by embedding a Calendly widget or using the built-in form to trigger an email. The blog will showcase your AI-generated posts nicely, and you can even tag or categorize them (the template likely has support for that, given Sanity’s flexibility). With Next.js 16, you also have the ability to create API Routes and Edge Functions – so integrating something like an AI chatbot in the docs page, or a “smart search” across your site (using OpenAI embeddings), is feasible. The template doesn’t provide those AI features out of the box, but it provides the infrastructure (auth, database) to build them if you choose.
In summary, the Agency template is a fantastic choice if you want maximum functionality and a polished UI from day one. It requires a bit more effort to tailor to your Git/AI workflow, but once configured, it will feel like a custom-built solution. Think of it as a powerful base that can grow with your business – you won’t need to redo the site when you add a new service or decide to launch a membership or anything; the pieces are already there. For a top-dollar investment in your site, this template ensures you get top-dollar features and presentation.
6. Taxonomy – Shadcn’s Full-Stack Next.js Example (Open Source, Free)
Link: GitHub – shadcn/taxonomy ・ Demo: tx.shadcn.com
Tech Stack: Next.js 13 App Dir, React 18, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI (shadcn/ui), Contentlayer + MDX (for blog & docs)[26], NextAuth (auth), Prisma + PlanetScale (MySQL) database, Stripe (subscription payments), TypeScript.
What’s Included: Taxonomy isn’t a template per se, but an open-source “kitchen sink” example application that demonstrates how to build a modern SaaS-like site with Next.js 13. It features a marketing website (with a homepage, pricing page, and documentation pages), a complete blog powered by MDX content[26], and an authenticated dashboard area (for logged-in users) with Stripe-powered subscription logic. In short, it has everything: static pages, dynamic content, authentication, database CRUD, and even an admin mode. The design uses shadcn’s UI components (built on Radix) extensively, so it’s consistent and accessible. There’s also built-in support for light/dark themes, and even generating OpenGraph images for blog posts.
Pros: This project is a goldmine of best practices and code you can learn from or repurpose. For your needs, the blog portion is immediately useful – it’s already set up with Contentlayer to pull MDX files for posts, and a lot of advanced features (comments, search, etc.) can be found in the code or discussions. The presence of a documentation section suggests a flexible content system (you could repurpose “Docs” into case studies or any structured content). Taxonomy aligns perfectly with the tech stack you outlined: Next.js App Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, MDX, etc., and it shows how to make them all work together at scale[27][28]. It’s also free and MIT-licensed.
For an agency “lab” site, you could use Taxonomy as a starting point to avoid reinventing wheels around user accounts or a Stripe billing page if those ever become relevant. Even if you don’t need auth right now, having the code for NextAuth and Stripe integration could be handy later (similar to the Agency template’s offerings). The UI style of Taxonomy is minimal and developer-centric, which means with some theming (fonts, colors) it can transform to match your brand. Because it’s the creation of the shadcn/ui author, it really showcases how to build a product with no UI library bloat – all components are local and customizable.
A big plus: Taxonomy’s blog and docs are MDX/Contentlayer-based, meaning it already meets your Git-based content requirement – you write markdown, push, and it becomes available on the site[26]. It even generates a RSS feed and sitemap. It uses Zod for validation in various places (ensuring data integrity). There’s also an example of using Vercel’s OG image generation for social sharing – a neat cutting-edge feature that you might appreciate.
Cons: The Taxonomy repository explicitly notes “This is not a starter template”[29] – it’s an evolving experiment. That means it might not be as plug-and-play as dedicated templates. There could be bits of unfinished or unstable code, since it was built on beta software (Next 13 beta, etc.) – though by 2026 most of those issues should be resolved or easily upgradable. Using Taxonomy as your base will require a careful read-through of the code to remove what you don’t need. For example, if you don’t want a user dashboard or any login functionality, you’ll strip out the NextAuth and related UI (which is doable, but touches many files). Similarly, you might not need the Stripe subscription flow – that can be excised. Essentially, pruning Taxonomy to fit your exact needs is a project in itself. If you embrace what it offers, you might end up with features you won’t actually use (like a docs section or multi-tenant user accounts).
Another con is that it may be overkill – similar to the Agency template, but even more so since it’s full-stack code. Performance-wise, with everything turned on, it’s doing a lot (connection to database, etc.), so you’ll want to ensure you statically generate where possible. Shadcn’s project was also known to be a bit heavy in dependencies (it pulls in quite a few libraries to showcase things). For instance, if you just want a static marketing site with blog, the whole auth/subscription system is unnecessary burden.
Use-Case Adaptability: Taxonomy is best used either as a reference implementation (to copy patterns or components from) or as a starting point if you indeed plan to use its extra capabilities. For your immediate needs (marketing site + blog), you might find Taxonomy requires too much stripping-down. On the other hand, reading its source can guide you on integrating certain features into whichever template you choose. For example, you could take the Contentlayer MDX setup from Taxonomy and apply it to NextPro. Or adopt the way Taxonomy does a table of contents or next/prev links in blog posts. If you foresee that you might offer some kind of client login area or AI-powered dashboard in the future, you might consider building on Taxonomy’s foundation now – thereby avoiding a migration later. It’s a forward-looking approach.
For AI integration specifically, Taxonomy doesn’t include AI, but it’s an ideal playground to add it. Since it has a backend (via Next API routes and server actions), you can plug in OpenAI API calls easily. Want a “Ask the Expert AI” chatbot on your site? Taxonomy has auth (so maybe only available to logged in users), a database (to store chat history or fine-tuned data), and the UI components to render a chat interface (you’d just need to write the logic using Vercel AI SDK). This might be beyond the scope of your website initially, but it shows that if you have Taxonomy as your base, adding interactive AI features is relatively straightforward because the infrastructure (server-side code, auth, DB) is in place[27][30].
In short, Taxonomy is a power-user option. If you love to tinker and want your site to potentially evolve into a full web app, it’s fantastic. If your focus is a marketing site with frequent blog posts, a lighter template might get you there faster with less overhead. Many developers use Taxonomy as a reference to cherry-pick code. You could do the same – e.g., use your simpler open-source starter for the base, but borrow Taxonomy’s MDX components or layout ideas to enrich it.

In conclusion, all these templates/starters are 2025/2026-ready and will give your agency site a strong foundation:
•	For a pure, content-focused approach with minimal fuss: Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog (No.1) is a proven choice, with a bit of custom page building on your part.
•	For a modern tech stack with lots of flexibility in UI components: ChangoMan’s MDX + Shadcn starter (No.2) is excellent, offering a clean slate with App Router and shadcn’s design system.
•	For trying the newest content tooling: Velite MDX starter (No.3) brings type-safe MDX and can set you apart by using the latest static site generator tech.
•	For design/UI completeness out of the box: NextPro (No.4) will fast-track the visuals and layout of your site – ideal if you want a polished look quickly and don’t mind integrating MDX yourself.
•	For a full-stack, longevity-minded solution: Agency template (No.5) gives you everything (CMS, auth, payments) – a bit of upfront work to align with your workflow, but it can serve your site as you grow and add features (it’s a true investment template).
•	For an advanced, in-depth base or reference: Taxonomy (No.6) is like getting an entire SaaS app’s code – you can use it to build not just a site, but an application. It’s perhaps more than you need right now, but it’s a fantastic resource to borrow ideas from (and who knows, maybe your “lab” grows into a community or product – you’d be ready).
Each of these is well-reviewed or well-starred in the community and should have active maintenance into 2026. Before deciding, you might try running a couple of them locally to see which aligns best with your comfort and vision. Given your willingness to invest time (and money, where needed) for a top-notch result, you have the luxury of picking a solid starting point and then tailoring it for your AI-driven workflow. Good luck with your website redesign – with Next.js 15+ and these templates, you’ll be able to build a truly dynamic “lab” that impresses visitors and is a joy for you to maintain!
