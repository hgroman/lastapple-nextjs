## SECTION 6: RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

### Potential Risks of Price Increase

**Risk 1: Existing Client Churn**
- Probability: Low (5-10%)
- Mitigation: 6-month grandfather period, value communication
- Impact: Minimal if managed proactively

**Risk 2: New Lead Conversion Rate Drop**
- Probability: Medium (10-20% initial drop possible)
- Mitigation: Better qualification, value-based selling, comparison tools
- Impact: Offset by higher revenue per client

**Risk 3: Competitive Response**
- Probability: Low (competitors unlikely to notice/respond)
- Mitigation: Maintain differentiation, focus on unique value
- Impact: Minimal

**Risk 4: Market Perception**
- Probability: Low
- Mitigation: Professional positioning, comprehensive market research
- Impact: Positive (premium brand perception)

### Expected Outcomes

**Best Case Scenario:**
- 100% client retention with grandfather period
- 80-90% new lead conversion at new pricing
- 35-45% revenue increase within 6 months

**Likely Scenario:**
- 90-95% client retention
- 70-80% new lead conversion
- 30-35% revenue increase within 6 months

**Worst Case Scenario:**
- 85% client retention
- 60% new lead conversion
- 15-20% revenue increase within 6 months

**Even worst case delivers positive outcome** due to higher per-client revenue offsetting any volume decrease.
