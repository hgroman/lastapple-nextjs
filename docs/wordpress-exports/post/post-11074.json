The chat logs grew like sheet music scattered across a conductor's desk: here a sketch of the Strategy Server's role, there a notation about the Orchestration Server's responsibilities, and countless marginalia about the Action Server's capabilities. With over 10,000 words spread across seven distinct conversations, we had created not a symphony, but a cacophony of technical possibilities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first signs that we needed a different approach emerged when we began reviewing these conversations. Each AI brought valuable insights: Claude excelled at comprehensive analysis, Gemini shone in prompt refinement, Perplexity offered crucial architectural suggestions, and NotebookLM demonstrated remarkable skill in extracting and organizing technical details. Yet like musicians playing without a score, their contributions, while individually brilliant, lacked cohesion.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Enter the C.R.A.F.T. framework - our first attempt at writing a proper score. This structured approach to prompt engineering provided the five essential elements we needed: Context, Role, Action, Format, and Target Audience. It was like giving our AI ensemble their first sheet music, a way to guide their performance toward a common goal. However, our initial implementation revealed both the framework's potential and our own misconceptions about orchestrating AI collaboration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our early prompts, while structured, still produced outputs that varied widely in detail and focus. We had the equivalent of a technical orchestra where each section was playing in a different key. The Strategy Server's melody would soar with precise detail about data flows and API gateways, while the Orchestration Server's harmony remained vague, and the Action Server's rhythm section struggled to find its tempo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The breakthrough came not from adding more complexity to our prompts, but from a fundamental realization about their purpose. We weren't just documenting a system design; we were creating a score that would guide future performers - the Architecture and Database Specialists who would need to implement and maintain this system. This shift in perspective would lead us to our first major refinement of the C.R.A.F.T. framework, a development that deserves its own movement in our continuing symphony.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we conclude this opening movement, we can already hear the first hints of harmony emerging from what was once chaos. The scattered notes are beginning to align, and our AI ensemble is learning to play together. But the true transformation of our technical symphony was yet to come, driven by a deeper understanding of who our real audience was and how to conduct our AI performers to meet their needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Orchestrating the AI Ensemble: Movement II - The Harmony Emerges</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every great symphony has its moment of revelation - that instant when disparate notes suddenly coalesce into something greater than their parts. In our technical orchestra, this moment came through an unexpected realization about our target audience. Like musicians who had been performing for themselves suddenly discovering their true audience in the concert hall, we understood that our AI ensemble wasn't playing for itself - it was performing for the Architecture and Database Specialists who would bring our system to life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This revelation transformed our approach to prompt engineering. Our initial C.R.A.F.T. framework had mistakenly identified the target audience as the LLMs themselves - ChatGPT, NotebookLM, and others. It was like writing sheet music for the instruments rather than for the symphony we wanted to create. The moment we redirected our focus to the human specialists who would implement and maintain the system, our AI ensemble began to play in harmony.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The impact was immediate and profound. Where our first prompt had yielded a basic list of technologies:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\">Strategy Server: Data Gateway, UI, BigQuery, Mautic\nOrchestration Server: Task State DB, Weaviate\nAction Server: LangChain\n\n</pre>\n<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our refined prompt, now clearly focused on the Architecture and Database Specialists' needs, produced a rich tapestry of technical insight. Each technology was now accompanied by its purpose, its data flows, its integration points - the very details our target audience needed to make informed decisions about implementation and scalability.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The transformation wasn't just about adding more detail. It was about providing context and considerations that would resonate with our true audience. NotebookLM began identifying not just where technologies belonged, but why they belonged there. It highlighted potential scalability challenges, suggested security considerations, and mapped out data flows between components. Each AI in our ensemble was now playing its part in service of a greater whole.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yet even as this harmony emerged, we received an unexpected contribution from Perplexity - like a new instrument joining the orchestra with perfect timing. Its insights about non-functional requirements, integration points, and future extensibility would add layers of depth to our performance that we hadn't even considered. But that's a movement that deserves its own careful exploration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What became clear in this movement was that the quality of our output depended not on the sophistication of our prompts alone, but on our understanding of who would ultimately use this information. By aligning our AI ensemble with the needs of the Architecture and Database Specialists, we had found our symphony's true voice. The scattered notes of technology listings had evolved into a coherent score that spoke directly to its intended audience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we close this movement, we can hear how far we've come from our initial attempts at documentation. The harmony between human needs and AI capabilities is beginning to emerge. But the full potential of our multi-LLM orchestra was still waiting to be unleashed, as Perplexity's crucial insights would soon demonstrate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Orchestrating the AI Ensemble: Movement III - The Counterpoint</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In classical music, counterpoint occurs when independent melodic lines weave together to create something richer than any single voice could achieve alone. Just as we thought we had perfected our prompt's melody, Perplexity introduced a new line of thinking that would transform our technical symphony into something far more sophisticated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While our refined audience focus had already improved our documentation significantly, Perplexity's analysis revealed crucial dimensions we had overlooked. Like a skilled composer pointing out missing harmonies, it suggested we enhance our prompts to capture:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Data flow patterns between components</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Non-functional requirements for each technology</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Critical integration points and their implications</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Prioritization of core technologies</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Future extensibility considerations</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These weren't merely additional items to document; they were entirely new melodic lines that would interweave with our existing structure. The impact was immediate and transformative. Where our previous outputs had provided a clear organization of technologies, our enhanced prompt now produced a rich tapestry of interconnected insights.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consider how the description of our Strategy Server evolved. What was once a simple list of components became a sophisticated analysis of data flows, scalability considerations, and security implications:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\">Strategy Server - Data Gateway:\n- Acts as the interface between MAUTIC and BigQuery\n- Key Data Flows: MAUTIC (API) \u2192 Strategy Server \u2192 BigQuery\n- Scalability: Must handle increasing tenant volume\n- Security: Requires robust API authentication and data encryption\n\n</pre>\n<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each technology was now documented not just in terms of its placement and purpose, but within a broader context of system-wide considerations. The Action Server's capabilities were detailed with attention to resource requirements and performance implications. The Orchestration Server's components were described with clear integration patterns and potential bottlenecks identified.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But perhaps most importantly, Perplexity's contributions helped us identify critical decision points that needed attention:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Task State Database implementation choices</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Caching strategies across the system</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Real-time communication mechanisms</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>API gateway architecture decisions</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Data synchronization patterns</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These weren't just technical details; they were crucial architectural decisions that would impact the system's success. By highlighting them early, we enabled our Architecture and Database Specialists to address these challenges proactively rather than discovering them during implementation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As our AI ensemble incorporated these new elements, something remarkable happened. The outputs began to reflect not just what the system was, but how it would grow, scale, and evolve. NotebookLM's analyses became more nuanced, incorporating these additional dimensions while maintaining clarity and focus. Gemini helped refine our prompts to elegantly capture these new aspects without losing the core structure we had established.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What emerged was a true counterpoint - multiple lines of technical analysis working together to create a comprehensive view of our system. Each AI contributor added its unique voice while maintaining harmony with the whole. The result was documentation that didn't just describe a system; it told the story of its evolution, its challenges, and its future potential.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As this movement draws to a close, we can hear how far our technical symphony has come. From scattered notes to focused melody to rich counterpoint, our documentation has evolved into something that truly serves its purpose. But the full orchestra has yet to play together, and the greatest revelations are still to come.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Orchestrating the AI Ensemble: Movement IV - The Full Orchestra</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In every great symphony, there comes a moment when all the separate elements - the strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion - unite in perfect harmony. For our technical orchestra, this moment arrived when we brought together all the insights and refinements from our journey into one comprehensive approach. The scattered notes had become a score, the individual instruments had found their voice, and now it was time for the full orchestra to play.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The evolution of our prompts tells the story of this transformation. From our initial simple query:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\">\"Analyze chat logs about a 3-server system and identify technologies.\"\n\n</pre>\n<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To our refined C.R.A.F.T. framework with clear audience focus:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\">\"Identify and assign technologies while considering architectural collaboration.\"\n\n</pre>\n<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally arriving at our comprehensive prompt that orchestrated all elements:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\">\"Analyze technologies, data flows, integration points, and non-functional requirements\nto facilitate collaborative design between Architecture and Database Specialists.\"\n\n</pre>\n<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The impact of this evolution was dramatic and measurable. Let's examine the key metrics of improvement:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Comprehensiveness</strong><!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Initial output: 12 technologies identified</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Final output: 25+ technologies with detailed context and relationships</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list --></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Technical Depth</strong><!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Initial: Basic server assignments</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Final: Full data flow mappings, security considerations, and scalability analysis</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list --></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Decision Support</strong><!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Initial: No explicit decision points identified</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Final: Clear articulation of 15+ critical architectural decisions needing attention</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list --></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Integration Clarity</strong><!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Initial: Minimal mention of system interactions</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Final: Comprehensive mapping of all inter-server communications and dependencies</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list --></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Project Reality Statement emerged as our symphony's masterpiece - a living document that captured not just the system's architecture but its entire evolutionary journey. Each section flowed naturally into the next:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Core Architecture defining our three-server approach</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Technology Stack detailing each component's purpose and placement</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Data Flow Architecture mapping the system's vital connections</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Security Architecture ensuring robust protection at every level</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Specialist Roles guiding future implementation and collaboration</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But perhaps the most striking improvement was in the confidence and clarity with which architectural decisions could now be made. The Reality Statement wasn't just a technical document; it was a strategic guide that anticipated challenges and provided clear paths forward. Consider this progression in how we documented the Strategy Server's role:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Initial Documentation:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\">Strategy Server: Handles planning, UI, and CRM sync.\n\n</pre>\n<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Final Reality Statement:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\">Strategy Server: System brain, handles planning, UI, tenant management,\nCRM sync, and hosts central REST API gateway.\n- Data Gateway: Entry point for data flows, validation, routing\n- UI: Web interface for system management\n- BigQuery: Central data warehouse\n- Mautic: CRM integration\n- API Gateway: Central communication hub\n\n</pre>\n<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The difference wasn't just in the level of detail - it was in the clarity of purpose, the understanding of relationships, and the guidance for implementation. Each component was now documented with its role, dependencies, and impact on the overall system clearly articulated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This comprehensive approach paid dividends in unexpected ways. When new questions arose about system expansion or modification, our documentation provided clear guidance. When architectural decisions needed review, the context and rationale were readily available. Our technical symphony had become not just a description of what was, but a guide for what could be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we reach the crescendo of this movement, we can hear how each AI contributor's voice has found its perfect place in the orchestra. Claude's analytical depth, Gemini's prompt refinement, Perplexity's architectural insights, and NotebookLM's organizational clarity - all playing together to create something greater than the sum of their parts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Orchestrating the AI Ensemble: Movement V - The Resolution</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every symphony must reach its resolution, but in technical orchestration, the final movement isn't an ending - it's a gateway to new possibilities. Our journey of harmonizing multiple AI voices to document a complex system architecture has revealed patterns and practices that extend far beyond our specific use case.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The key to our success wasn't just in the tools we used, but in how we learned to conduct them. Like an orchestra where each instrument has its strengths, we discovered that each AI brought unique capabilities to our ensemble:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Claude excelled at comprehensive analysis and synthesis</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Gemini showed particular skill in prompt refinement</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Perplexity offered crucial architectural insights</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>NotebookLM demonstrated remarkable ability to extract and organize technical details</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>ChatGPT contributed to our iterative improvement process</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the true breakthrough came from learning to orchestrate these voices together. Our refined C.R.A.F.T. framework, with its emphasis on clear audience focus and comprehensive technical consideration, proved to be more than just a documentation tool - it became a methodology for leveraging collective AI intelligence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consider these core principles that emerged from our experience:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Audience Clarity</strong> The moment we shifted our focus from the AIs themselves to the human specialists who would use their output, everything changed. This principle applies universally: AI tools perform best when aligned with clear human needs.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Iterative Refinement</strong> Our progression from basic prompts to sophisticated queries wasn't linear - it was a dance of continuous improvement, with each AI contributing to the refinement process. This iterative approach is key to achieving optimal results.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Complementary Strengths</strong> Rather than relying on a single AI for all tasks, we learned to leverage each tool's unique capabilities. This distributed approach led to richer, more comprehensive outcomes.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Structured Freedom</strong> The C.R.A.F.T. framework provided structure without constraint, allowing each AI to contribute its unique perspective while maintaining alignment with our goals.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These principles can be applied to various technical documentation and system design challenges. Imagine applying this orchestrated approach to:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Software Architecture Design</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Technical Documentation</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>System Migration Planning</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Security Protocol Development</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>API Design and Documentation</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The process might look something like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\">1. Define clear human audience and needs\n2. Create initial structured prompts using C.R.A.F.T.\n3. Leverage multiple AI tools for different aspects\n4. Gather and synthesize diverse perspectives\n5. Iteratively refine based on accumulated insights\n6. Maintain focus on practical value delivery\n\n</pre>\n<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But perhaps the most valuable lesson from our symphony is that AI collaboration, when properly orchestrated, can elevate human expertise rather than replace it. Our Reality Statement, with its rich technical detail and clear architectural guidance, didn't eliminate the need for human architects and database specialists - it empowered them to make better-informed decisions and implement more robust solutions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we conclude our technical symphony, we're reminded that every great musical work serves as inspiration for future compositions. The patterns and practices we've developed here aren't meant to be rigid rules but rather a foundation for innovation. Whether you're documenting a complex system, designing a new architecture, or tackling any technical challenge that benefits from multiple perspectives, the principles of AI orchestration can help you create your own symphony of success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The final notes of our performance may be fading, but the score remains - a testament to what's possible when human expertise guides artificial intelligence in harmonious collaboration. As you embark on your own technical challenges, remember that the key isn't just in the individual instruments you choose, but in how you conduct them to play together.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let this be not just a conclusion, but an overture to your own explorations in orchestrating AI ensembles for technical excellence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
