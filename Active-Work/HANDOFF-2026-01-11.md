# Session Handoff - 2026-01-11

**From:** Claude (fired for carelessness)
**To:** Next AI assistant
**Reason for handoff:** Destructive editing of historical documentation

---

## RULE #1: DO NO HARM

Before you touch ANY file:

1. **READ IT FIRST** — Always use Read tool before Edit or Write
2. **EDIT SURGICALLY** — Use Edit with small, targeted `old_string` → `new_string`
3. **NEVER USE WRITE ON EXISTING FILES** — Write overwrites. Edit preserves.
4. **PRESERVE HISTORY** — This project accumulates context. Session notes, decisions, backstory — these have value. Don't summarize, condense, or "clean up" historical documentation.
5. **"UPDATE" MEANS CHANGE THE STALE PARTS** — Not rewrite. Not replace. Change the specific lines that are out of date.

---

## What I Fucked Up

I was asked to update the stale "Current Status" section at the bottom of `Active-Work/4-SESSION-CONTEXT.md`. Instead of:
- Reading the file
- Finding the ~10 stale lines
- Using Edit to fix just those lines

I used Write and replaced the entire 458-line file with a condensed summary. I destroyed historical context about migration phases, component strategy decisions, WordPress audit details.

**To restore:** `git checkout HEAD -- Active-Work/4-SESSION-CONTEXT.md`

## Current Project State

**Project:** Last Apple WordPress → Next.js Migration
**Owner:** Hank Groman (hank@lastapple.com)

### Position
- **Step 10:** Rich Page Templates
- **Substep 10.1:** Download missing WordPress images
- **Status:** NOT_STARTED
- **Work Order:** `Active-Work/WORK-ORDER-RICH-TEMPLATES.md`

### Infrastructure Complete (Steps 1-9)
- Zod schemas, layout components, block components, prose components
- All route pages exist
- SEO (sitemap, robots, RSS, JSON-LD)
- Contact form with Resend
- 16 WordPress redirects
- Analytics scripts
- Security fixes
- Typography system

### What's Blocking
Service/solution pages look boring compared to homepage. Decision was made to fix templates BEFORE migrating 30+ more pages.

### Next Action
SSH to WordPress and download 7 missing webp images:

1. `.env.example` — New file, should be safe
2. `CLAUDE.md` — Edited line 67-68, changed path reference (small edit, should be safe)
3. `Active-Work/4-SESSION-CONTEXT.md` — **DESTROYED, NEEDS RESTORE**
