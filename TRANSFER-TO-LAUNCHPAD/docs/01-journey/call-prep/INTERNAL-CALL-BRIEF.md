## THE SITUATION IN 30 SECONDS

- 40-year translation business, sisters Anna-Maria & Marie-Pierre recently acquired it
- Website built 6 years ago by **Nova Creative** (Dayton agency) - they've "lost contact"
- They've been brave enough to do plugin updates themselves
- Scared to do WordPress core update without proper backups
- Brad Davis (their hosting provider for 20 years) referred you
- She reached out same day as referral = warm lead, expecting premium service

---

## CRITICAL: THE NOVA CREATIVE SITUATION

### What She Said:
> "We've **lost contact** with the people who developed our website **6 years ago**."

### How to Handle:

**DO SAY:**
- "Six years is a long time in the web world. Relationships run their course - that's common."
- "The good news is we're starting fresh with clean slate and fresh eyes."
- "Nova Creative built you a solid foundation - site's still running well."

**NEVER SAY:**
- "What were you paying Nova Creative?"
- "Why did you stop working with them?"
- "Did you have unpaid bills?"
- "Can you get access from them?"

---

## PRICING STRATEGY

### Recommend: WordPress Essentials @ $149/month

**Why This Tier:**
- They need core maintenance (updates, backups, security)
- NOT asking for SEO, CRM, AI content
- Clean, working site (well-built foundation)
- Budget-conscious business model
- Small business scale

### The Tiered Offer (Use This Approach):

> "Based on what you've shared, I see two paths:
>
> 1. **WordPress Essentials at $149/month** - All core maintenance, daily backups, security, plus 1 hour content edits. This is our 'peace of mind' tier.
>
> 2. **Growth Accelerator at $249/month** - Everything in Essentials PLUS proactive SEO monitoring, weekly plugin compatibility checks, AI-driven keyword analysis, and 2 hours content edits. This is for clients who want us as strategic partners.
>
> Given you're a 40-year business and your website is critical for credibility, where do you see LinguaTech fitting?"

### Value Frame:
- $149/month = $35/week
- Less than one hour of emergency support if something broke
- Unlimited access for critical issues

## CALL STRUCTURE (35 minutes)

### Phase 1: Connection (3-5 min)
**Script:** "Anna-Maria, great to connect! Brad speaks highly of you. I looked at your site - Nova Creative did a nice job with the design. It's held up well."

### Phase 2: Understanding the Gap (5-7 min)
**Ask:** "Talk me through what happened with the original developer. Not looking for drama, just want to understand the timeline."

**Listen for:** Budget issues? Communication breakdown? Natural drift? Ownership chaos?

**Then reframe:** "Six years is a long time. This is common. The good news is they built you a solid foundation."

### Phase 3: Discovery (10-12 min)
- What's the website's business purpose?
- Current pain points?
- What broke them out of DIY mode?
- Decision-making process (both sisters?)
- Timeline expectations?

### Phase 4: Solution (8-10 min)
- Recommend WordPress Essentials ($149/mo)
- Explain onboarding process
- Address backup concerns specifically
- Mention Growth Accelerator as option
- De-risk: "Worst case, you get a complete site audit"

### Phase 5: Next Steps (3-5 min)
**DON'T close on this call.**

**Script:** "Let me send you a detailed proposal with our onboarding checklist and first-month action plan. That way you and Marie-Pierre can review together."

**Timeline:** "I can have that to you by Monday. If it looks good, we could start onboarding by next Wednesday."

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (Budget Without Asking)

### 1. Scope Discovery:
"Tell me about your website's role. Is it a digital brochure that stays static? Active lead generation? Needs frequent content updates?"

### 2. Pain Point Pricing:
"What keeps you up at night about the website? Fear of it breaking? Security updates? Search rankings? All of the above?"

### 3. Comparison Anchor:
"Most translation/professional services clients fall into two categories:
- **Peace of mind tier** (updates, backups, security) = $149-249/month
- **Growth partner tier** (SEO, content, optimization) = $249-499/month

Where do you see LinguaTech?"

### 4. Previous Investment (soft probe):
"Was website maintenance a separate line item with your previous developer, or rolled into project work?"

---

## THE SISTER DYNAMIC

Anna-Maria is your contact, but Marie-Pierre is co-owner.

**Always say:**
- "For you and Marie-Pierre to review..."
- "Once you both are comfortable..."
- "Would Marie-Pierre want to be on the next call?"

## YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

| Nova Creative | You (Last Apple) |
|--------------|------------------|
| Full-service agency (diluted focus) | WordPress specialist (this is ALL you do) |
| Client services → PM → developer | Direct owner: "You're talking to the owner" |
| General marketing expertise | 30 years system integration expertise |
| Hourly/project billing (surprise invoices) | Fixed monthly retainer (predictable) |
| Agency model | White-glove philosophy |

---

## THE ONBOARDING PITCH

> "Here's what I love about starting fresh: **We document everything.**
>
> Our onboarding:
> 1. **Complete site audit** - health, security, performance baseline
> 2. **Comprehensive documentation** - so you're never in this position again
> 3. **Access audit** - make sure YOU have all admin credentials
> 4. **Backup verification** - test that backups actually restore
> 5. **30-day action plan** - prioritized list of what needs attention
>
> You'll know exactly what state your site is in, what we're doing, and why. No mysteries."

---

## RED FLAGS & RESPONSES

### If she mentions settling up with Nova Creative:
> "Let's table that. Our engagement is with you directly - we don't need anything from your previous developer to get started."

### If she asks about contacting Nova Creative:
> "I wouldn't worry about that yet. Let's get admin access, run our assessment, then decide together if reaching out would add value. Often it doesn't - the site speaks for itself."

### If she says "$149 is higher than expected" (unlikely for 40-year business):
> "What were you expecting?" (get their number)
> Then negotiate features, not price. Or offer 3-month trial at $129, then $149.

## BLINK TEST - READ HER REACTION

| If She Says... | Signal | Your Action |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| "That sounds reasonable" (no hesitation) | Left $50-100/month on table | Start here, upsell in 90 days |
| "What's included?" or "Can we customize?" | Price at threshold | $149 is perfect |
| Hesitates, asks about cheaper options | At ceiling (rare) | Explain value, don't negotiate down |

---

## THE CLOSE

> "Here's what I'd love to do: Put together a detailed proposal and onboarding plan customized for LinguaTech. I'll include the full assessment checklist, timeline, and first-month action items. That way you have something concrete to review with Marie-Pierre.
