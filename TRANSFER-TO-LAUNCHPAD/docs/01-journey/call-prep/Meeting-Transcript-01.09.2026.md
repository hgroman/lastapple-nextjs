  Hello?

0:03 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Hello, this is Hank. How are you?

0:05 - amcon
  Good. How are you? I'm so sorry about that. I'm so sorry about the wait.

0:10 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  You're fine. No, you're fine. It's a busy Friday.

0:16 - amcon
  No, I felt bad. I couldn't find the Zoom meeting link. Oh, hi. Hey. So, can you hear me well?

0:25 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yes, I can. And it's so funny because I was calling your cell phone.

0:28 - amcon
  Oh, you were. And then all of a sudden you were in my ear, but you hadn't answered.

0:32 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  And I'm like, oh, hold on. She's on the Zoom. Okay.

0:36 - amcon
  That's okay. Yeah, sorry. I panicked. I was like, oh, my God, I better call him to let him know.  I didn't leave him hanging. I just couldn't find the link.

0:44 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah, you're good.

0:46 - amcon
  Anyway, nice to meet you, Hank. Yeah, nice to meet you.

0:49 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah, it's an interesting technology Friday. I've, you know, some days are like that. And I've, I've had one of those already where you just realize, you know, maybe.  Maybe this is a go-to-the-beach day, because if it's not going to cooperate with me, don't fight it. Don't fight it, yes, that just means you're not meant to be, yeah, doing what you're doing, exactly.

1:12 - amcon
  No, but with Zoom meetings, too, I mean, you'd think we'd be used to them after COVID, but I never got used to them.  I'm always like, scrap, like, what?

1:22 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  You know, I got used to them, and I've got some clients who love Teams, and I'm like, yeah, no.  I just, I like the way Zoom works, it just works. Teams is kind of clunky, it's another Microsoft, I don't know, half-baked idea that they acquired, and I'm like, no, but.  I know, I know what you mean, sometimes some clients have sent, like, Teams requests, and then it's like, okay, I have to download the whole thing and get all, yeah, so it's a bit brazzling having to learn that.

1:52 - amcon
  That's not my area of expertise, which kind of ties into, you know, websites. I'm not being expertise at all, so.

2:02 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  That's fun. So I have to ask, what is that cool glowing box over your right shoulder?

2:09 - amcon
  Oh, that, sorry, the computer?

2:13 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Okay, that's your tower with a glass case. This one?

2:18 - amcon
  Yeah, it's, yeah, we had new computers. So, yeah, we work from home, so we had new computers, and that one is a gaming computer because we find that with the programs we use, gaming computers work the best for our needs.  So they make gaming computers really cool with these glowy lights, so.

2:37 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  That is so, my kids would be so jealous. That's . I just, I love it.

2:44 - amcon
  I know, it's funny, actually. It's insane, like, because we work with a lot of, like, we open a lot of programs at once because we're a translation agency.  I don't know if Brad.

2:54 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Oh, yeah, I dug in. Yeah.

2:56 - amcon
  dug in.

2:57 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  I did some research. She's 40 years Have you guys been doing this? The company?

3:02 - amcon
  Not myself, no, because that would make me about eight years old. Just kidding. No, no. The woman that we bought the company from, yeah, no, she had started it like a long time ago, back in the 80s.  So, and then we purchased the company from her, I'd say it's already been about seven years, seven or eight years.

3:24 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Okay.

3:25 - amcon
  And then we moved to Dayton, Ohio, when we took over. So we moved from Canada, actually, so. Okay.

3:34 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah.

3:35 - amcon
  Yeah. How do you like the move down?

3:38 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  I just did the opposite for a little stretch. I'm in Southern California. I went to see my mom. We've got property in upstate Pennsylvania for a whole life.  It was a camping property that when my mom and dad retired, they put a house there. And so I go out to see her often.  And so I drove my daughter out because she started. College, and she wanted to do one last trip, but she flew back, and I hung out with my mom, and to get back, I drove my mom, and we went up into Canada, over all the Great Lakes, came in around, what, Minnesota?  We snuck back in, and then did the top of the country to the coast, so yeah, I finally got my taste of Canada there.

4:24 - amcon
  Yeah, that's quite a road trip. No, I've never done that before. We just flew here. We just flew here.

4:31 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  You're, like, You're the smart one, you know.

4:35 - amcon
  No, but how do we like it? It's definitely a big change from the west coast, as, you know, you probably can guess, you know?

4:44 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Oh, so you were up there, you were up on the west coast of Canada there, so you went from all of the...  Did I say Vancouver?

4:52 - amcon
  So we moved from Vancouver, Canada, yeah.

4:55 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Gosh. I know, yeah.

4:57 - amcon
  That's something.

4:58 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Right.

4:59 - amcon
  That's trick.

5:00 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  People are like, what are you doing here in the Midwest?

5:03 - amcon
  Yeah, that's a trick.

5:05 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  It's a change of pace.

5:06 - amcon
  We had a, we have, in Canada, we had a translation agency, but a lot of the clients that this woman had with Linguatech were our clients.  Like, she would just subcontract to us. So when she decided to retire, and we realized that we would lose, like, you know, 60% of the clientele if she sold to someone else who had their own translators.  So we did something crazy, decided to invest in her company. And so, and so we needed, you know, people here, I guess, I mean, people here.  I mean, we could have, we could have stayed in Vancouver and just remotely done it and all that. But yeah, like I said, we just decided to pack up and move.  And yeah, so it's my sister and I yeah, it's my sister and I that own the company. My sister stayed back for a while and I stayed, came here and kind of managed.  Things.

6:01 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah. And then stayed.

6:05 - amcon
  That's pretty cool.

6:06 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Um, it does have its beauty.

6:08 - amcon
  The Midwest has its beauty. The people are definitely wonderful.

6:12 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah. Um, you're like, yeah, no, I, I, I'm saying, I mean, I'm an East coaster. So, I mean, Ohio is kind of like part of my, what I would call my old stomping grounds.  Um, but what a place to be. I mean, it's like a, what do they call those now? Megalopolis, Decagopolis, when you just have so many cities all in row, because you've got Cleveland, Dayton, you've got like, you know, Pittsburgh's not that far down.  You know, you can, you can go up to, um, uh, Buffalo and, um, Erie and like, it's just, it's just so much.  I mean, and if you really want to drive, go to Chicago and, you know, so maybe that's a, that's a plan.

6:57 - amcon
  Oh, come on. Get over there. Get over there.

7:02 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Well, that's interesting. Your space is not born to me. I did somewhere around 99. I was doing work with IBM via voice and Dragon actually speaking where we were creating custom language models for like all of the ologies where we had like this crazy transcript database from the US.  Navy from all the reports and we were able to do wordsmithing to get all of the vocabularies done for all of those and sell the different specialties.  And then I went to the contact center technology for about 15 plus years. And then I started out on my own somewhere around seven years ago.  I'm losing track. And interestingly enough, voice automated is... It was one of my big clients who, I did that work four years ago, and I've been helping them work with Dragon Medical One and the whole Dragon Co-Pilot and the ambient technology.  So I'm aware of the different kinds of requirements for the horsepower you got there. Right.

8:19 - amcon
  It's funny you say Dragon. Yeah, we had tried that, I remember, but that was like, I don't know, a while back, like 15 years back or so.  And it was probably, I mean, now it's probably nothing like it was when we tried it, just to, you know, instead of typing, because we spent a lot of time typing and everything, right, to voice.  And I remember my dad trying it as well, and it worked for the most part, like just having your, you know, whatever you're speaking into it, we'll type whatever, right, that is Dragon, right?  Yeah. Because I was like, I'm pretty sure that was it, but, but yeah, I mean, even my husband who trans.  I mean, he's lost so much, like, feelings in his, uh, so I, I told him about it. I said, you should give it a try.  You should, you should see what's out there for, um, you know, software technologies that, that allow you to speak as you, your translation, right, instead of typing them.

9:19 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  I would, I would look into it for those very reasons. Um, I'm a pianist, so I, the more I use my voice, the better.  Um, and I've, I've, I'm on a Mac now. I've gotten so accustomed to just, I hit control key twice, tap, tap, and I talk everything.  And so my productivity is, is through the roof. Um, and, and you think differently when you're staring at a wall in the white noise of your own brain, forming your thoughts, right.

9:48 - amcon
  It's more fluid.

9:49 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah. You know, than having to hunt and peck every, so.

9:53 - amcon
  Yeah, no, that's true, actually. Yeah. Go ahead.

9:56 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Well, check it out, too, because, you know, one of the things that they've got now. Um, and, and there are trials.  Um, I'm buddies with Trey and Henry who are the owners of Voice Automated. I can be like, Hey man, you got to hook them up, give them a trial.  Um, and, and he can try it out.

10:12 - amcon
  Yeah. And that's not, I get nothing out of it.

10:14 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  I'm not trying to, don't even think I would even go down the path. You might want to tell them like, look, it's harmless.  You got seven days and they can extend it and have them try it out for a little bit because it could be a game changer.

10:25 - amcon
  Quality of life. Oh yeah. And so what are there is, is it still called the same, like, is it dragon or is it, or is this, or this is a different.

10:35 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  There's, it's still dragon medical one. Um, that's, that's the key one. there is like dragon professional and then there's, um, there's law, you know, there's dragon legal, but those are kind of fringe, um, dragon medical ones.  They're just crazy. And now they're doing things where they came out with, um, with the, the boon of all the AI technology, they,  It out with what they call ambient listening. So a doctor will be in a patient interaction and they'll just have it listening.  And instead of them having to do all the reports, it just picks up everything. And of course, you can have templates and triggers.  And so it'll just listen to the whole interaction, which is kind of cool because then you play the whole, if doctors get tired or if they forget to ask something and all that fun stuff.  So that one's kind of fun.

11:29 - amcon
  Yeah, it's neat. Yeah.

11:33 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  But let me zoom out. You know, I imagine, okay, let's zoom way out.

11:41 - amcon
  Yes. I've known Brad for I don't even know how many years now.

11:45 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  So you and I both know him like forever, 20 years. You know, he's been helping with the hosting there.  And anybody he introduces me to, I just want to help. There have been a lot of cases. There Where he's brought me people where they just have a flat, you know, and I just fix the flat, and then I'm just in the wings.  So I imagine probably the first thing you want to do is get me connected and let's get you a backup.  So you know that, like, you can sleep. Like, if we wanted to change to upgrade WordPress without hurting ourselves and have, you know, backwards compatibility, we could, or if we want to investigate upgrading plugins, you know, you'll at least know you've got that peace of mind.

12:38 - amcon
  Right. That's the first thing I do. I think that's the thing is that after the website was done, I mean, this is, again, I think about seven years ago that we did the website.  And we lost touch with the people that had created it, like I said. So, but, you know, I would go in and just click update whenever it asked me to.  So I didn't really ask any questions. And I know through Brad, like we renew the SSL certificates and all that keep up to date with making sure everything is like, um, working functional, functional.  But I think that the the the issue there of Yeah, when I went in last, and I noticed there was like, all these plugins that needed updating.  And sometimes it's like they're asking stuff to that. I don't know if it's a requirement, or they're just trying to send me something extra for the website, but I have no idea what it is, what it does, if it's to our benefit.  I mean, so, um, so there's that lack of knowledge that makes me a bit, you know, like, overwhelmed. And I and I don't want to.  And then also the the update to WordPress and backing up the whole website, like I said, I'm like, well, what does that entail?  What, you know, I read into it, but I'm just I was just, I yeah. Yeah. So definitely having someone that knows their way around WordPress, because I don't want to assume that I would know how to get around all that, and nor do I want to test it out, seeing the last thing I want is the website, you know, crashing.

14:14 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Right.

14:15 - amcon
  So I think that's the thing, is just looking for exactly someone that, you know, can go in there and just do their magic and just make it functional, make it updated.  And yeah, I think the easiest would be exactly like, once you go in, you will see, I mean, it also talks about different, oh, what was it?  There was something else that it talked about, but I don't remember the word, the wording, like I said, again, it's just extra stuff.  And then there's like the site health where it's like telling me critical conditions and is it critical or is it just saying that?

14:52 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I'll definitely, I can hop on and see how you are. And I. I'm happy to just, let's just take a look.  Let's get the way of the land, you know.

15:06 - amcon
  You might find that there's nothing much to it as far as, yeah, it's just like regular, like you said, you know, just regular maintenance, just updating stuff and just making sure everything's running smoothly.  That might be, maybe it's not in their caution burn yet. Yeah, yeah.

15:22 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  So, I mean, we can do that. And then I can let you know, you know, what's what. But don't even worry about cost or any of that fun stuff.  You know, if it's a simple thing, it's just, let's just, let's just get you fixed, you know.

15:36 - amcon
  I appreciate that, Hank.

15:37 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah, I mean, it's, like I said, I've known Brad a long time. So I like, we, you know, we're business buddies.

15:47 - amcon
  Yeah.

15:48 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  So I don't mind helping, you know, if it's too painful, I might say like, okay, hey, can you get me like a Starbucks gift card or something?  But I think anything else can be premature. Sure. Why don't we figure out where you're at and what's going on and make sure that you're healthy and get you backed up.  And I can tell you before I do anything like, okay, here's what I see. I think you can safely do these plugins and then do your core WordPress type of thing.  A lot of times what I will find is that, let's say somebody used a builder, a page builder like WPBakery or Elementor.  You might run into dependencies where I might go, okay, we got to upgrade these plugins because this one enables your contact form, and that's important.  This one's rendering your, you know, your calendar or your images or whatever. And we can't upgrade those until we upgrade this, which means we have to upgrade that.  So if that's the case, I'll be like, yeah, you might, you got to upgrade your license for. WP Bakery, if you still want to use it, and that type of thing.  So I kind of look at it holistically, you know, and let you know.

17:09 - amcon
  I remember there was something that mentioned that if we wanted to update to something, it needed a license key, and I'm like, I don't remember getting a license key, but I don't know, like, again, I mean, it might be an extra that is not needed, but if not, I would try to find that license key.

17:29 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah.

17:31 - amcon
  But I, there was something else. Yeah, I mean, I, yeah, appreciate you looking, looking at it from, you know, like, just to see you like, okay, these are just simple updates and whatnot.  But I was wondering, too, because I don't know, for example, when there are other linguatechs. And so some people have told us, you know, when they'll do a search, they'll come up with the other linguatech that's in Texas, or that's in Utah, or whatever.  Or, um... And so how do you do it so that when people do searches, like, is that something that comes from the WordPress or is that like when people search on your web, search for you, for, for you to have your website come out first, is that, I don't know.  So that, oh yeah.

18:21 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah. So that's going into the land of search engine optimization. That's SEO. So there are different ways you can go about it.  You kind of got to look at it, the whole picture. And I think about the different orders to present the information.  If you said, hey, we're getting beat by so-and-so, I'd go, okay, well, let's take a look at your site and your content and the key SEO indicators.  And then tell me, let's look at who's beating you and let's see what they got. So, a lot of times, things can be fixed by addressing the basics.  The most important thing in search engine optimization is your title. So, you go, I would say, well, let's look at your pages really quick.  And I've got tools for all this fun stuff. And you look for the low-hanging fruit and the red flags.  It's like, hold on a second. All your pages say the same thing. Big red flag. Let's get all your titles set up so they definitely talk about what they're supposed to be.  And then you look at their structural foundational building blocks to SEO. Make sure your titles are set. Use H1 tags, header 1, header 2, header 3.  A lot of times, you can just take the existing content on a page and restructure it so you properly use headers.  And Google likes you when you do that because you make its job easier.

19:59 - amcon
  Because... And you to news.

20:00 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Now when it gets to your page and it crawls it again, it's like, oh, thank you for telling me how your content's organized and what's important because now I can verify, yeah, that's, so a couple key examples, images, make sure if your page is talking about a certain aspect of your translation services, make sure the title says that, your headers leverage that semantically, your images reinforce that, and you look at, if you want to get a little bit deeper, then you start to look into how much content do you have, you know, is, yeah, I'm just like a little bit, you're hoping you get found with, we need to expand that, or you have a bunch, and it just needs to be reorganized semantically, so, now, before I babble too much, that's kind of the, you start with the basics, and you expand, I've done it a lot, I recently recently brought,  I brought a biotechnology company back to life. Their site got hacked. They got a bunch of bad links and they went down into like the 60s and I got them back up to number one.  So I know how to win the game. You just got to pick your battles. And if we said, you know, that'd be the first thing I'd look at is let's just take a look at structure.  Are there any gotchas? Let's get them out of the way because that often helps a lot. And it's the gift that keeps giving.  Once you do it, you just, you do a best practice. Anytime you add new content, follow these rules, do the titles, right?  Do the everything I said. But then if you fix that stuff and you're like, you know, why are we still not good?  Then I go, okay, let's look at your services. Make sure they're all reinforcing what you want to be found for.  One more tangent before I go back to a basic and that's blogging is an awesome. Some way to go ahead and create content to make Google happy.  Google looks at four things. It's like your experience, your expertise, your authority, and your trust, right? And when you blog, you get to demonstrate all of those.  So if you start talking about certain challenges that people have, like when selecting somebody like you for these services, and you're demonstrating that, like, you know, you've been there, done that.  You've helped on board people. You've seen what happens when people go for the cheap route, the long-term price they pay, and why you really have to, you know.  And it's also upselling. So it's like you get what you pay for, and that's why we might be a little bit more, but you want us type of thing.  You know, you're closing. It helps you at all levels. But the other thing you want to do. And I got competing thoughts here is don't put the cart before the horse.  You know, I would start with, okay, what are people searching for?

23:09 - amcon
  Right.

23:10 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Because a lot of times we're like, I want to get down for blue boxes. And it's like, nobody's searching for blue boxes.  Like you got to go with green squares. Like that's, that's what everybody's searching for. So let's engineer your content to be where people are looking.

23:25 - amcon
  Right.

23:26 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Or it's just not even worth your time. So zooming way out. Yeah. Are the basics covered? Is your technical foundation set?  Are your titles and your headers and your images all reinforcing your content?

23:42 - amcon
  Yes or no. You got to fix it regardless of what people are searching for.

23:45 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  You know, that's where you are. That's your truth. Then zoom out. If we want to get you found for stuff, what are people looking for?

23:53 - amcon
  Let's know that first before you go down any path and then zoom out and go, okay. Right. It's almost like working backwards.  It's like, what are, yeah, what are people that are interested in our services? What are they searching, right? Like, are they searching languages?  They might be, right? Because obviously, you know, I suspect that if they would be looking for, oh, we need translation for this language, this, you know, international language, they're going to type it in and look for translation in Haitian Creole, let's say, or whatever.  And so hopefully, like, that would be where, you know, I mean, we do have a list. mean, you, I think you've seen our website, we do have a list, we have a page where we are, you know, we mention all the languages that we do.  So I mean, I would, I would suspect that would kind of, kind of ping us for, for languages that are being researched.  But I, but again, I don't know how, yeah, but you explained it well, how it kind of works at, you know, finding us, I guess, putting us in first place.

24:57 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah. So it's.

25:00 - amcon
  Um, but yeah, I mean, that's something that we can, we can look at, you know, like after and seeing if there is that, uh, a lot of times we wonder how people, I mean, we have gotten, we have a, um, a page where, uh, it says to contact us and people can say what they need, what their needs are.  Right.

25:22 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Um, so we have, you know, people contact us like that.

25:25 - amcon
  Um, so they do find us, I guess, obviously, um, when they put us in, um, but, uh, but a lot of it is, I would say, um, uh, networking, like people who have known, um, you know, people who know people basically, right.  Yeah. Um, we move companies and, uh, they come into the new company and they're like, oh, well, we used to work at, you know, with this translation agency and data and blah, blah, blah.  So, um, so I don't know how much of the website is giving us, um, you know. Any sort of, what do you call it?  Revenants. Yeah. Right? Yeah. I do know we have been contacted through it, but we also get contacted a lot of, like, we get a lot of spam.  We get a lot of gibberish. A lot. So I'm like, it's probably more 80% gibberish and, you know, spam that they went in and filled up the fields.  And so it looks like, and versus, you know, legitimate, interested people, right?

26:34 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah. And you can do things. can put in a contact form that uses, like, a reCAPTCHA, which kind of prevents that.

26:40 - amcon
  Yeah. We don't have that. Let me look. I think. Oh, no.

26:44 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Perfect. Yeah. We can check on that.

26:49 - amcon
  Yeah. No, we have a reCAPTCHA, and yet. And they're still getting through it. And they're still getting through it because we get, yeah, would say like 80% of the.  Emails we get from the Let's Chat page are spam, right?

27:07 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  You might need to dust that off and see.

27:10 - amcon
  Perhaps that's a maintenance issue. Is it working? Is it really working? Like I said, I mean, when you go in there, might not just be, you know, plugins and updates.  It might be, you know, looking at, I don't know, are there, there's other things that need attention that have, that, that need to be dusted off.  I don't know, like honestly.

  I'll take a look. You know.

27:32 - amcon
  I'll take a look.

27:33 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  This is something we do every day, all day. So it's kind of, you get sensitive to persnickety in your own kitchen.  You want your house in order, you know, so you kind of, things bother you when you're kind of like, oh, we got to move that.  So I kind of, I, I, I do appreciate very much your time, like looking into it.

27:59 - amcon
  You know, I, I really. Absolutely do. Like it's, you let us know what you find. And I think that, you know, after, like I said, we can look at also maybe if you have recommendations of what the website might need or like, or, or again, what we were talking about, you know, seeing how we can be in that search engine, know, come up more predominantly over the other translation companies.  Right. Right. Cool.

28:26 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah. You know, we, can, yeah.

28:29 - amcon
  Discuss that after and see. Cause I, I do feel, I mean, it's, you know, we have our clients and I think sometimes I hate to say, but we felt comfortable with that.

28:39 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Right.

28:39 - amcon
  We're comfortable where we sit, but then other times we're like, okay, you know, it would be nice to kind of network and go out there and have, you know, maybe more people like looking at our site or looking at, you know, the services we offer.

28:53 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Right. Yeah. Cause I, I think, yeah, go ahead. I think it serves. A lot of good purposes. I mean, of course, you'd love to have a pipeline that is unmanageable because you're just, sorry, we don't have time.  That'd be a great problem. You know, that's the most beautiful end result, right? But at the same time, I think every time you go and you revisit your messaging and what you're saying or what you think you're saying versus what you're actually saying, you look in the mirror for a little bit and good things come out of it.  Because you go like, oh, wait a hell in a second. We can improve that. We can say that better.  Or wait, why do we not have this? And every time you do it, it just gets better. So I'm a big, even, this is what I do and I don't even get to my site.

29:46 - amcon
  So, I mean. But I do agree, right? I mean, this was seven years ago when we took over. We've learned a lot since then.  We've grown a lot since then. And there's definitely a lot of new... So, anyway. Information or new experiences that we have to potentially, like, share and put out there, right?

30:06 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Well, and that's a place I can tell you where the art of content generation has almost gotten enjoyable. You know, I would say, you know, if and when we got to that point where you said, okay, you know what, we do need to kind of, like, go through a session where we, let's look at the content, and then let's talk about some of those lessons.  I would say, don't tell me anything now, because what we'll do is we'll hop on the Zoom, and we'll just take the transcript.  And what's really cool is as you talk about things, and your natural flow of thought goes, and you explore a thought, and you're like, oh, wait a minute, that reminds me, there is that.  And things just kind of evolve, and then we say, okay, let's give that to AI and get a transcript.  Let's identify the content topics that were exposed and reviewed in juxtaposition to the actual site content. Are we saying that everywhere?  Are we not seeing that everywhere? Okay, hold on. And you kind of like do a heat map and say, okay, that definitely calls for a new page here or a new page there or revisions to this and that.

31:09 - amcon
  Right. That's it.

31:10 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  So my point, I didn't make it sound easy, but it actually is because you just talk. And because you're just talking and you're taking the transcript and you're leveraging AI for that, it's like, okay, cool.  I mean, we just came up with three new pages and it was fun. So let's do it. you know, so it's not like, because you've seen technology and how this, I mean, don't you get excited when you think about like grabbing the yellow notepad and sitting down at the kitchen table and going, all right, so what's the content we're going to do?  Like, oh, God, it's not fun. You know, it doesn't have to be that way anymore.

31:46 - amcon
  Yeah. Oh, that's what's amazing, right? It's definitely technology has taken us to a whole different level where it's almost like the thoughts that you have, but that you cannot put together in your head.  Because that happens to me a lot. I thought for. Frazzled, and I'm looking for my words, but I can do that for you.  can pretty much, you know, help you to gather your thoughts into something that is cohesive and actually sounds nicely packaged.  Right.

32:44 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Where words would likely be associated with other words. And so we could think that like we did a horrible job of explaining something because our thoughts were fragmented and we didn't quite get it out.  But it's not looking at it like that. It converted everything you said into meaning. And it's using. Semantic analysis to go, no, you said it just fine.  I got what you meant. This is where you were going. you're like, dude, holy crap, like you did.

33:10 - amcon
  You got it. And you're like, okay, I don't have to be perfect to get my thoughts out. So it's kind of a saving I would say that that's because the AI machine doesn't have a mom brain, but that would be, you know.

33:23 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  A mom brain?

33:24 - amcon
  happens to us. Yes. Yeah. It's true, though, right? It's, I mean, probably whatever it came out with is exactly, oh, this is exactly what I wanted to say.  The AI figured out exactly what I wanted to say that I couldn't say it because I have a mom brain right now.  But no, seriously, it is true, right? I mean, I definitely could gather my thoughts better before. But now, so I know what you mean.  It's like, it's amazing that it can take what you're wanting to say, even though it sounds all fragmented, exactly, and all over the place, and it can actually turn it into a.  You know, a cohesive piece of meaning.

34:04 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Well, it's adding, it does intent analysis, too. So it's, if it's following your train of thought, and how the thoughts unfold, it's supplying like, well, where are you coming from?  Why would you bring that up? Okay, I get, you know, and it's doing that, it's like a digital shrink.  So it's, I'm a fan. What can I say?

34:28 - amcon
  No, of course, as long as it doesn't take over, you know, translation world. We're okay.

34:33 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Yeah, I don't think it will. I don't think it will. We still need, you still need, I talked to a pilot and I'm sorry?

34:44 - amcon
  Context. Context is lost. Something that, context and cultural, go ahead, what you were going to say, but yeah.

34:52 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  Well, you need a driver. I don't care if you're driving a Ferrari. You still need to make corrections. You know, the engine itself might be fast.  But I found that it gets lost quickly. And if it gets lost quickly, it is really willing to fail hard.  You know, it's like that degree, if you leave in a plane, and you're off by one degree, you're going to end up in the wrong city.  And I found with a lot of AI conversations that it will improperly lock onto an assumption. And I don't care if you talk to it for an hour.  It'll let you know, finally, you'll see a slip, a crack in the arm and you're like, you still think I want to go that way.  I told you, we are going this way. And because it's math.

35:43 - amcon
  And it's only doing math.

35:45 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
  And it went down either the evens or the odds path in multiples. And once it does, it's like you have to recognize when to cut your losses and go, okay, summarize what you think we're talking about as best as you can.  And we're going to take that and I'm to start a new chat with that because you cannot readjust it.  It's just a mathematical fact. So I say all of that to say, I don't see it taken over anytime soon.  And if it does, it's going to be bad because it'll really take us in a wrong direction. It could try, but you still need humans correcting, you know, so, okay, babble, babble, babble.
  ACTION ITEM: Send WP admin creds to Hank via self-destruct; he'll add admin user, backup, audit, fix reCAPTCHA, update - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cKJW4X7u6L-BEmuvGnRrdxHnDip3MXr_?timestamp=2179.9999

38:04 - amcon
  Right, yeah, sounds good. Well, I appreciate it, again, I really appreciate your time, you know, looking into it, and thank you so much for setting up the meeting.  was nice talking to you. We could keep on going for a long time all about this.

38:18 - Hank Groman (lastapple.com)
