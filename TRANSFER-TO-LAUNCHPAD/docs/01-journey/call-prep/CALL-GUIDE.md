**RECOMMENDATION: Option B** (tiered choice - highest close rate)

---

## OPENING (3 minutes)

**YOU:** "Anna-Maria, great to connect. Brad speaks very highly of you and LinguaTech. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge - Nova Creative did a really nice job with your site six years ago. It's held up well, which speaks to the quality of the original build."

**[Pause - let her respond]**

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
- Honors past relationship (no drama)
- Positions you as evolution, not replacement
- Shows you did homework
- Builds trust immediately

---

## DISCOVERY PHASE (10 minutes)

### Question 1: The Gap
**YOU:** "Walk me through what happened with your original developer. Not looking for drama - just understanding the timeline so I know what support looked like before."

**[LISTEN FOR]:**
- Budget issues → Price-sensitive
- Communication breakdown → They value responsiveness
- Ownership transition → Natural gap during acquisition
- Developer moved on → No hard feelings

**[YOUR MENTAL NOTE]:** This tells you their pain tolerance and budget ceiling.

---

### Question 2: The Trigger
**YOU:** "What finally made you reach out to Brad? What broke the 'I'll figure it out myself' mode?"

**[LISTEN FOR]:**
- "Afraid to update" → Need backup/confidence
- "Site health warnings" → Need expert guidance
- "Don't know what's critical" → Need education
- "Spent 3 hours on one plugin" → Need time back

**[YOUR MENTAL NOTE]:** Their trigger = your value proposition.

---

### Question 3: Website's Role
**YOU:** "Help me understand what your website does for LinguaTech's business. Is it a digital brochure, a lead generation tool, or something else?"

**[LISTEN FOR]:**
- "Credibility signal" → They're professional service, site = trust
- "Source of leads" → They need uptime/performance
- "Client resource" → They need reliability
- "Not that important" → (Unlikely for 40-year business)

**[YOUR MENTAL NOTE]:** This sets value context for pricing.

---

### Question 4: The Decision
**YOU:** "Are you and Marie-Pierre making this decision together, or do you want to take a proposal back to her?"

**[CRITICAL - Sets closing expectations]**

**IF:** "We decide together" → You need buy-in today
**IF:** "I'll take it to her" → You need proposal she can champion

---

### Question 5: The Horror Story
**YOU:** "Have you had any bad experiences with website issues - something that went wrong, site went down, data lost - anything that keeps you up at night about the website?"

**[LISTEN FOR]:**
- Specific incident → Pain point you solve
- "Not yet, but..." → Prevention value
- "Nothing serious" → They've been lucky

**[YOUR MENTAL NOTE]:** Pain = willingness to pay premium.

---

## PRICING PRESENTATION (8 minutes)

### Setup Statement:
**YOU:** "Based on what you've shared, I see two paths forward. Let me walk through both and you tell me which feels right."

---

### TIER 1: WordPress Essentials - $149/month

**YOU:** "This is our **peace of mind tier**. Designed for businesses that want their website maintained properly without thinking about it.

**What's included:**
- All WordPress updates (core, plugins, themes)
- **Daily backups** - not weekly, daily
- Security monitoring and malware scanning
- Performance optimization
- **1 hour per month** of content updates - fixing typos, updating hours, small stuff
- Unlimited access if something breaks

**Who it's for:** Businesses where the website works well, they just need expert eyes keeping it healthy.

**Investment:** $149/month. No setup fee. Cancel anytime with 30 days notice.

**That's $35 a week**. Less than one emergency hour with a developer."

**[PAUSE - Watch their face]**

---

### TIER 2: Growth Accelerator - $249/month

**YOU:** "This is our **strategic partner tier**. Everything in Essentials, plus we become more proactive about your site's performance and visibility.

**What's added:**
- Weekly plugin compatibility checks (before updates break things)
- Enhanced performance optimization
- **2 hours per month** content updates instead of 1
- Proactive recommendations, not just reactive fixes

**Who it's for:** Businesses that want their website to be an asset that gets better over time, not just maintained.

**Investment:** $249/month.

**The difference:** For $100 more per month, we're not just maintaining - we're improving."

**[PAUSE - Watch their face again]**

---

### The Question:
**YOU:** "Given what I know about LinguaTech - 40 years in business, acquisition by you and Marie-Pierre, website is your credibility signal - where do you see yourselves? Peace of mind tier, or strategic partner tier?"

**[SHUT UP AND LET THEM TALK]**

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "That's higher than I expected"
**YOU:** "What were you expecting? Let me make sure I'm showing you the right fit."

**[GET THEIR NUMBER, THEN]:**

**YOU:** "At $[their number], you're in the DIY or basic freelancer range. Here's what you'd sacrifice: [list 3 things]. The question is: what's it worth to not worry about your website for the next 40 years?"

---

### "I need to think about it"
**YOU:** "Absolutely. What specifically do you need to think through? Is it budget, features, timing, or something else?"

**[ISOLATE THE REAL OBJECTION]**

---

### "Can we start smaller?"
**YOU:** "We could, but here's my honest take: Based on what you've told me, you need Essentials minimum. Going cheaper means DIY territory, which is what you're trying to get away from.

How about this: Let's start with Essentials at $149. After 90 days, if you're getting more value than expected, we talk about Growth Accelerator. Fair?"

---

### "What if we want to cancel?"
**YOU:** "30 days notice, that's it. No penalty, no hassle. Here's why I'm confident: After 90 days of our service, you won't want to cancel. But you're not locked in."

---

## THE VALUE REFRAME (Use if needed)

**YOU:** "Let me put this in perspective. Last week, how much time did you spend worrying about or working on your website?"

**[THEY ANSWER - Let's say 2 hours]**

**YOU:** "Two hours. What's your time worth? Even at $75/hour, that's $150. That's what you're spending anyway - except you're doing it yourself, you're not sure if you're doing it right, and you're taking time away from running LinguaTech.

For $149/month, you get expert support, daily backups, security monitoring, and you get your 2 hours back every week. That's not a cost - that's a return."

---

## CLOSING (5 minutes)

### If They're Ready to Decide:

**YOU:** "Great. Here's what happens next:

**Next 24 hours:**

---

1. Detailed proposal (you can share with Marie-Pierre)
2. Onboarding process outline
3. First 30 days action plan
4. Client testimonial from similar professional services business

**What I need from you:**
- Best way to follow up - should I reach out to both of you, or just you?
- Timeline - when do you want to make a decision by?
- Any other questions I can answer in the proposal?

**Then we'll schedule 15 minutes next week to answer questions and move forward if it's a fit.**

How's that sound?"

---

2. **"We understand operational impact"** - Minor site changes affect frontline
3. **"White-glove, US-based"** - Direct owner access, no overseas handoff

---

## FINAL REMINDER:

**You're not selling maintenance. You're selling:**
- Peace of mind
- Time back
- Expert partnership
- Business continuity
- 40 more years without website worry

**They're not buying updates. They're buying:**
- Confidence in their digital presence
- Freedom to focus on translation business
- Protection of 40-year reputation
- Evolution after ownership transition

**Price objection = Value communication failure**

If they balk at price, you didn't sell the value hard enough. Go back to pain points and ROI.

---

## ONE-LINER TO CLOSE:

**"Anna-Maria, here's the truth: You spent 40 years building LinguaTech's reputation. Your website is how people verify that reputation in 2026. For $149/month - less than you'd spend on business cards - you ensure that first impression is always perfect. That's not an expense. That's protecting everything you and Marie-Pierre acquired."**

---

**YOU'VE GOT THIS.**

They called YOU. Brad referred YOU. They WANT to work with you. Your job is to not screw it up by being weird about pricing. Quote confidently. Justify with value. Close professionally.
