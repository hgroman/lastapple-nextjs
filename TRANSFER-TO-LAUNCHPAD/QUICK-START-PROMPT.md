# Quick Start Prompt

Copy and paste this to Claude when you start in ai-lab-launchpad:

I'm rebuilding lastapple.com. This repo (ai-lab-launchpad) is a Lovable-built mockup that I want to deploy and make content-editable.

**Immediate goals (2 hours):**
1. Deploy this Vite app to Vercel as-is
2. Add markdown content reading so I can edit content via Git
3. Set up WordPress SSH export so I can pull real content

**Context:**
- This is a business website for Last Apple Business Solutions
- I have SSH access to the current WordPress site at lastapple.com
- I want to edit content via Claude Code + Git commits
- Check the `docs/` folder for architecture reference (but don't over-engineer)
- Check `wordpress/` folder for WP-CLI export scripts

**Start by:**
1. Run `npm install && npm run dev` to verify it works
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Then we'll add content reading

Let's go. No planning docs. Just build.
