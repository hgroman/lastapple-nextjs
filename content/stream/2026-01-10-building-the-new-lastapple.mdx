Today marks a turning point. After years of wrestling with WordPress - database corruption, plugin conflicts, the constant fear of breaking something - we're building something different.

## The Vision

Edit content from my phone at a red light. Claude commits to Git. Site updates in 90 seconds.

No database. No CMS. Just files, Git, and conversation.

## Why Now?

The WordPress experiment failed. We tried Git integration with `wp dbvc import` and it overwrote 60,000+ lines of settings. Site broke. Lesson learned.

**File-first beats database-first.**

## What We're Building

- Next.js 15+ with App Router
- Content as MDX files in Git
- Zod schemas for validation
- Claude as the content editor

The website isn't the product. The conversation is the product. The website is just the artifact.
